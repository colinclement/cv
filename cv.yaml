projects:
  - keywords: inference, regularization, convex optimization, model selection
    title: Bayesian Inference of Currents from Magnetic Flux Images
    details: 'Inferring currents from magnetic images is a deconvolution problem
        I solved by using convex optimization to regularize the maximum likelihood
        with finite-support and novel isotropic total variation priors.  '
  - keywords: machine learning, inverse Ising, clustering, geometry, complex systems
    title: Effective Models of Spin Glasses
    details: 'I found effective coarse-grained models of spin glasses---a canonical
        model for a disordered solid---using information theoretic clustering and
        minimum probability flow learning. This method promises more interpretable
        maximum entropy models for complex systems.'
  - keywords: image registration, inference, bias in maximum likelihood
    title: Multi-Image Registration for cryoSTEM and Aberration Correction
    details: 'Image registration is necessary to improve signal-to-noise in low 
        temperature electron microscopy, and to correct aberrations both before
        and after image formation. I developed a maximum likelihood theory to study
        this problem and analyze the inherent bias in estimating image shifts.
